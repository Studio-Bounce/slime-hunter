============================


QUICK START
-----------
The default rendering version on this package is HDRP. If you want to upgrade for either URP or Standard rendering pipeline, you may do so by importing the provided unity packages inside the folder "Assets\Nokdef_VFXPack\SpellsPack3\Upgrades"

If you get script errors on the camera or post process volume, you can either delete them, or get the official unity post process package. (Regarding the preview scene only)

Once you have the right rendering pipeline selected, you can simply choose a particle system inside of the "Assets\Nokdef_VFXPack\SpellsPack3" folder and drag it into the scene.
